					 <P>This crew produced some pretty decent material, and as Rick
						was a big fan of the heavy British bands, took a step away from the
						Flipper-esque proto-noise found in the first set. </P> 
					 <P>All ages gigs became common with our general refusal to play
						bar shows and a desire to play for the kids who formed the majority of the
						crowd. </P> 
					 <P>At this point the What's Right cassette was recorded. Steve
						Heineman (my bandmate from Real Enemy and White Wreckage) and I were involved
						with the recording, and I play on several of the songs. Mike Michalski left,

					 <P>This version played some pretty powerful shows, but all was
						not well. There are sayings about bands with 5 people in them, and they're all
						true. It's always 3 vs. 2. It's dynamic, but always 3 vs. 2. And so in late
						1985 we ended up with 3....</P>
