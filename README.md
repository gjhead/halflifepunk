Archive of the (very) old Half Life website.  Saved for posterity and overdue for a redesign.

This was the old website for Half Life created initially by the band back when the "All Our Yesterdays" compilation came out.

While the domain lapsed, I ended up saving the domain and got in touch with Vince Curtis to ask if I could post the site back up
until I could do something more significant.  

This will be live at halflifepunk.com for some time while a new site is created.  Half Life was important.  This stuff
needs to be documented.
